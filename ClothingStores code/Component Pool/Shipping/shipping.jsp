            <p>We're happy to offer Free Standard Shipping on orders over $100 USD! For orders under $100 USD see shipping costs below. Orders may ship in multiple packages.

Most orders will ship out within a day of ordering (we do not ship Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), however some orders will take 24-48 hours to process. Your order will be shipped via Standard Shipping unless you select an alternative.

We ship orders to all US states and territories, APO/FPO addresses as well as more than 100 other countries and regions. For more information, visit the international shipping page. Orders shipped to PO boxes, APO/FPO, Alaska, Hawaii and US territories cannot be expedited.</p>
